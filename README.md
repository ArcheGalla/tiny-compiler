# Tiny Interepter

A tiny interpreter which shows the basics of compiler implementation.

For more details see [the source](./tiny.js).

Along the implementation you can find sample (and simple) implementations of:

- Lexer which produces a list of tokens (module for lexical analysis).
- Parser which produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) (module for syntax analysis).
- Interpreter which traverses and evaluates the AST.
